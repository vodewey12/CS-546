            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>I am a junior software engineer (3/4). I like to do almost anything and isn't afraid to try new
                things. However, I mainly play guitar, rock climb, play basketball, and program video games as my
                hobby. As a software engineer, I like to make apps that are generally useless and gimmicky but
                utilizes a different feature each time </p>
